Intelligent trash can

This project came with me observing that people aren't able to recognize trash by it's material as we can see that there are a lot of trash in the wrong trash can. We aren't able but an AI must be able to do it. So what if we could make the trash can itself recognize the material of the trash that was threw in the trash can and then separate the trash itself? Humans would only need to throw the trash into the trash can and in the end all trash would be in it's respective place.
